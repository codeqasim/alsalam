<p>AirFinch allows hosts to choose among standardized <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/home/cancellation_policies">cancellation policies</a> (Super strict, Strict, Liberal, Moderate, Long Term and Flexible ) that we enforce to protect both hosts and guests. A host's cancellation policy can be found in the Prices section of their listing page. Guests must agree to the host's cancellation policy when they make a reservation.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<p>Each listing and reservation on our site will clearly state the cancellation policy. Guests may cancel and review any penalties by viewing their travel plans and then clicking 'Cancel' on the appropriate reservation.</p>
