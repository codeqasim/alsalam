<p>Your payment information is collected when you submit a reservation request. Once the host accepts your request, or if you book a reservation with <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/187" target="_blank">Instant Book</a>, your payment method will be charged for the entire amount at that time.</p>

<p>Whether the reservation is two days or two months away, we hold the payment until 24 hours after check-in before giving it to the host. This hold gives both parties time to make sure that everything is as expected.</p>

<h4>Long term reservations</h4>

<p>If you book a reservation for 28 nights or more, you’ll be charged a first month down payment when the reservation is confirmed. Then, the rest of the nights will be charged on a monthly basis.</p>

<h4>Security deposits</h4>

<p>If your listing requires a security deposit, you won’t be charged unless the host files a successful claim within 48 hours of your checkout. &nbsp;</p>
